Using mutable default arguments like `[]` or `{}` in Python is a common pitfall. These defaults are evaluated only once—when the function is defined—not each time it's called. This means values persist between calls, which is rarely what you want. Instead, use `None` as the default and initialize the list inside the function. This ensures a new list is created for each call, avoiding hidden bugs that are hard to trace.
